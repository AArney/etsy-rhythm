Etsy Rhythm

This is a plug-in for wordpress that retrieves and displays items from your shop.

I built upon the Etsy Shop plug-in by Frédéric Sheedy  (email : sheedf@gmail.com). Only several functions were included,
overall this plug-in is a complete overhaul.

For now you can set how many items are retrieved, options to show the creator, when it was made, the materials, 
and the currency. This plug-in was built using the WordPress plug-in template and as such has unused functions and 
properties.
